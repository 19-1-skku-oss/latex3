\textbf{Skeleton for next l3news ... sections to be added and filled in}

There has been something of a gap since the last \LaTeX3 News, but this does
not mean that work has not been going on. The Team have been working on a
number of areas, many of which reflect wider take-up of \pkg{expl3}. There have
also been a number of significant new developments in the \LaTeX3
\enquote{sphere} in the last year.

\section{Move of sources from SVN to Git}

For a long time we maintained the \LaTeX3 sources in SVN but also provided a
readonly clone of them on Github using the SubGit software from TMate Software
to syncronize the two repositories---a solution that worked very well.

We have now retired the SVN repository and completely moved over to
Github.

\section{\pkg{expl3} updates and extensions throughout the year}

\textbf{just a list of change notes, to be expanded and/or partially dropped}


\subsection{Release 2017-01-28}

\begin{itemize}
\item Remove deprecated function \cs{scan_align_safe_stop:}
\item Remove deprecated key properties \texttt{.value_required:}
  and \texttt{.value_forbidden:}
\item Bug fix for \cs{l_char_active_seq}
\item Index improvements in interface3/source3
\item Improve internal robustness of l3sort
\item Better uniformity for \texttt{rand()} and related
  FPU functions
\item Basic key inheritance in l3keys
\item New experimental functions for selecting random
  entries in seq data, etc.
\end{itemize}  

\subsection{Release 2017-02-17}

In this release the l3sort module is integrated
into l3kernel and so available directly on loading
expl3. As part of this move, the 'result' functions
have been renamed to
\begin{itemize}
\item \cs{sort_return_same:}
\item \cs{sort_return_swapped:}
\end{itemize}  
with the older names (\cs{sort_ordered:} and
\cs{sort_reversed:}) retained until the end of 2018.

This release also extends l3docstrip to aid with
the LaTeX23 'boundary': the notation \cs{@@@@par} in a
source will now yield \cs{@@par} in the live code.


\subsection{Release 2017-04-01}

\subsubsection{Boolean functions}

This release marks the functions
\cs{bool_lazy_all:n(TF)},
\cs{bool_lazy_and:nn(TF)},
\cs{bool_lazy_any:n(TF)} and
\cs{bool_lazy_or:nn(TF)}
as stable. This will be followed at a later date by a change in
\cs{bool_if:n(TF)}, which will move to being greedy: this change is
necessary as there are circumstances under which \cs{bool_if:n(TF)}
currently fails with a low-level error due to lazy evaluation.

Package authors are encouraged to consider employing these new functions
where appropriate.

\subsubsection{Version identifiers}

From this release the SVN \verb=$Id= lines are removed from \LaTeX3 sources. The
function \cs{GetIdInfo} is deprecated from this release, and the team
recommend that package authors include version information directly in
\cs{ProvidesExplPackage} (or similar) lines.


After some internal discussion, we will be retaining \cs{GetIdInfo} as their
are several possible use cases: for the team's own use we will not be
using SVN Id's as release identifiers.



\subsection{Release 2017-07-15}

\begin{itemize}
\item New \cs{hbox_set_to_wd:Nnw} and \cs{vbox_set_to_ht:Nnw} functions
\item Revised l3file module to give better defined
  path/file/extension split
\item New experimental functions in l3file: \cs{file_input_stop:},
  \cs{file_get_mdfive_hash:nN}, \cs{file_get_size:nN} and
  \cs{file_get_timestamp:nN}; currently \hologo{XeTeX} does not support
  getting file size/timestamp
\item New experimental \cs{mode_leave_vertical:} as a code-level
  equivalent of \cs{leavevmode}
\item New experimental support for shell escape in l3sys module
\item New mechanism for checking variable declarations locally:
  see option "enable-debug" and
  \cs{debug_check_declarations_(on|off)}:
\item More invalid regex patterns trapped with warning
\item More regex documentation examples
\item Bug fix for \cs{tl_mixed_case:n(n)} with \hologo{pdfTeX} when the first
  character is outside the ASCII range
\item Fix nesting of selective setting in l3keys
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Fix loading of l3str-format
 \item Fix handling of \cs{iow_newline:} in \cs{iow_wrap:nnnN}
 \item \cs{cs_generate_variant:Nn} now warns on incorrect variant
   relationships
 \item Better recovery by \cs{dim_set:Nn}, etc., if passed
   skip expressions
 \item Better handling of global/local consistency in variable
   setting
 \item String mappings now include space characters
 \item Revise l3doc to no longer require "[aux]" (deprecated) or
   "[int]" in code mark up: "[int]" is retained for cases where
   auto-detection of internals is not possible
 \item Deprecate \cs{token_new:Nn}
 \item Documentation improvements
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Wrong use of \cs{cs_generate_variant:Nn}}

\textbf{discuss why we are going to disallow some versions}



\subsection{Release 2017-12-16}

\begin{itemize}
\item New \cs{prg_generate_conditional_variant:Nnn} function
\item Add missing \cs{tl_if_novalue_p:n}
\item Make \cs{IfBooleanTF} robust against multi\itemtoken arguments
- Some doc fixes 
\end{itemize}



\section{\pkg{l3build} updates throughout the year}

\textbf{just a list of change notes, to be expanded and/or partially dropped}

\begin{itemize}
\item Retain test file name in .tlg files
\item Normalise out paths for image files
\item Macro support (regression-test.tex) updated such that
  all macros are documented, with some used for LaTeX2e kernel
  work removed
\item New typesetsourcefiles variables
\item Support for subdirectory structures in sources
\item New variable \texttt{recordstatus} for included the output status of each test in the tlg file. This allows an easy way to check whether operations such as loading a package doesn't trigger an error message.
\end{itemize}

Moved \pkg{l3build} to its own repository:

\url{https://github.com/latex3/l3build}


\subsection{Release 2017-12-06}

\begin{itemize}
\item Normalisation extended to cover
  register allocation and
  \cs{show} applied to boxes
\item New typesetruns variable
\item Documentation improvements
\end{itemize}


\textbf{.tlg files may be needed for this release}

\subsection{Release 2017-12-12}

\begin{itemize}
\item Option \texttt{-t|--testfiledir} is removed
\item New checkconfigs variable allows use of multiple test
  configurations
\item Support for complex layouts via docfiledir and sourcefildir
  variables
\item New hook for building demos when scripting is needed
\end{itemize}
