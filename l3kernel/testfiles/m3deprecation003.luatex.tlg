I suspect you have forgotten a `}', causing me
to read past where you wanted me to stop.
I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,

LaTeX does not know anything more about this error, sorry.
Try typing <return> to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.

You've closed more groups than you opened.
Such booboos are generally harmless, so keep going.
